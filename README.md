# TassuPs-Throwback
TassuP's Throwback is my entry for the GitHub Game Off 2017.

It's a classical point and click adventure game, where the main character is a game programmer called TassuP. He kinda looks like Guybrush Threepwood, but that's just a coincidence. The game is based on a real life situation, where TassuP (that's me) has just finished his entry for Procjam and now has to think of an idea for another game jam: The GitHub Game Off.

The theme of the jam is "Throwback", which obviously means there will be many games with huge pixels. Not that I have anything against that art style, but... Or maybe I do. Don't get me wrong, I love good pixel art but I've just seen too much of it. So therefore in this game you can turn off the Ugly Pixels effect, and enjoy some vector drawings instead. But if you really like big pixels, you can leave the effect on. Be my guest!

Anyway, where was I...

The theme "Throwback" is interpreted in this game in many ways. The player is thrown back in time to when everything was still 2D and the pixels were huge! I mean they were gigantic!!! (Oh boy, here we go again)

Ahem... Excuse me.

All the puzzles and jokes are references to classic games. There's a Nethack dungeon with a dead newt, a NES Zapper, mutant ninja turtles and just about every cool thing ever invented in any game (minus a few I saved for the sequel).

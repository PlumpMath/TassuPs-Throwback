Game name ideas:
	- TassuP's Throwback


Dialog system:
	+ PoolStringArrays used one by one every time hotspot is clicked
	+ # separates sentences
	+ $ triggers something


Throwback ideas:
	- a reversion to an earlier ancestral characteristic
		= powerup that transforms player into a caveman or amoeba

	- a person or thing having the characteristics of a former time
		+ me as a child

	- a nostalgia for something in the past (fashion, movies, literature, games, technology)
		- elements from nostalgic games
			- Nintendo zapper
			- Roguelike dungeon
			- Point 'n' click?
			- DeLorean that throws TassuP Back To The Future
			- Princess is in another castle
			- Zelda-like treasure boxes
			- Pacman ghosts
			- Super Mario pipe

	- something retro—a blast from the past
		- 8bit music?
		+ pixelized graphics (optional)
		- pixelized effects?

	- something passé—no longer fashionable or popular

	- throwing something back—as in a ball or reply





### Intro cutscene ###

A kid version me (TassuP) is sitting at his computer. He has just submitted his entry to the Procjam 2017. The computer screen shows a screenshot of Niceland.


TassuP is thinking:
"Yay!"
"My Procjam entry is done."
"Check it out at tassup.itch.io"
"And there's time to make something for GitHub Game Off!"
"I must think of an idea. "
"What's the theme, let's see."
"Hmm.. "
"'Throwback'."
"Oh geez!"
"There's gonna be sooo many pixelized retro remakes!"
"I'm tired of those."
"I have to think of something else."
"Something... Zzz... "
"Nostalgic... ZZzzZZzzz..."


TassuP falls asleep while thinking about nostalgic game ideas. In his dreams he is thrown back in time into a game world that is filled with elements from the games he played as a child. He finds a Nintendo Zapper, Zelda-like treasure boxes and stuff like that in a nethack-like dungeon. He makes his way deeper into the dungeons and ends up in gnomish mines. Lots of monsters there. He finds Toads who tell him the Princess is in another castle.





### Game Starts ###

TassuP: "Oh no! I've been thrown back in time to an era when everything was still 2D! And I'm a child again! Damn, there's pixels everywhere. Could you please change the settings for me? Press ESC and disable the annoying retro shader."



	### Jojo puzzle
	There's a hole in the ground blocking the path.
	Player must use Jojo as a monkey wrench on a nearby water pipe to fill the hole with water.
	Then use mutagen on a dead newt to transform into a were-newt.
	Then player will swim across to the other side.
	Mutagen will then wear off and player turns into himself again.



### Enging scene ###

TassuP finds his way out from the horrible mines trough a Super Mario pipe only to find himself in the middle of a chaotic battlefield. Just as the Space Invaders are attacking, TassuP finds a DeLorean, gets thrown Back In To The Future and wakes up.

"ZZzzZAAaaaAAaarGGGH!!!"
"Huh?"
"Oh..."
"I'm here again."
"What a crazy dream!"
"Hey! I just had an idea!"
"Oh my gosh, this game is going to so cool!"
"Thanks for playing! You really helped me out."

Then it's Game Over and Credits.

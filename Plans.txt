Game name ideas:
	- TassuP's Throwback


Dialog system:
	+ PoolStringArrays used one by one every time hotspot is clicked
	+ # separates sentences
	+ $ triggers something


Throwback ideas:
	- a reversion to an earlier ancestral characteristic
		- powerup that transforms player into a caveman or amoeba? Nah...

	- a person or thing having the characteristics of a former time
		- player is transformed into a 2D-sprite

	- a nostalgia for something in the past (fashion, movies, literature, games, technology)
		- elements from nostalgic games
			- Nintendo zapper
			- Roguelike dungeon
			- Point 'n' click
			- DeLorean that throws TassuP Back To The Future
			- Princess is in another castle
			- Zelda-like treasure boxes
			- Pacman ghosts
			- Super Mario pipe
			- Jojo the monkey wrench

	- something retro—a blast from the past
		- 8bit music?
		+ pixelized graphics (optional)

	- something passé—no longer fashionable or popular

	- throwing something back—as in a ball or reply





### Intro cutscene ###

A kid version me (TassuP) is sitting at his computer. He has just submitted his entry to the Procjam 2017. The computer screen shows a screenshot of Niceland.


TassuP is thinking:
"Yay!"
"My Procjam entry is done."
"Check it out at tassup.itch.io"
"And there's time to make something for GitHub Game Off!"
"I must think of an idea. "
"What's the theme, let's see."
"Hmm.. "
"'Throwback'."
"Oh geez!"
"There's gonna be sooo many pixelized retro remakes!"
"I'm tired of those."
"I have to think of something else."
"Something... Zzz... "
"Nostalgic... ZZzzZZzzz..."


TassuP falls asleep while thinking about nostalgic game ideas. In his dreams he is thrown back in time into a game world that is filled with elements from the games he played as a child.


### Game Starts ###

TassuP: "Oh no! I've been thrown back in time to an era when everything was still 2D! And I'm a child again! Damn, there's pixels everywhere. Could you please change the settings for me? Press ESC and disable the annoying retro shader."



	### Nethack puzzle
	There's a hole in the ground blocking the path.
	Player must put turtles inside the water tank to provide turtle power for the pump.	
	Then remove Jojo the monkey wrench from nearby water pipe to fill the ravine with water.
	Then use mutagen on a dead newt to transform into a were-newt.
	Then player can swim across to the other side.
	Mutagen will then wear off and player turns into himself again.

	### Super Mario puzzle
	Bowser is blocking the way.
	Player finds a Mario box but can't reach it.
	Player must put jojo into a Donkey Kong barrel.
	The barrel shoots Jojo to the box and Nintendo Zapper falls down.
	Player must shoot Bowser with Zapper.
	Player can then proceed to Toad. Toad hanks player and says the princess is in another castle.
	Player can then exit trough a pipe.

	### Space Invaders puzzle
	Player can do lots of things, but nothing helps.
	The Space Invaders just keep coming and will eventually destroy everything.


### Ending scene ###
The Space Invaders destroy planet Earth and TassuP wakes up screaming. Then he realizes it was all a dream. Now he has a cool idea for the GitHub Game Off.


"ZZzzZAAaaaAAaarGGGH!!!"
"Huh?"
"Oh..."
"I'm here again."
"What a crazy dream!"
"Hey! I just had an idea!"
"Oh my gosh, this game is going to be so cool!"
"Thanks for playing! You really helped me out."

Then it's Game Over and Credits.

Something like that.
